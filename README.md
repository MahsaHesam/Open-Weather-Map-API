**WeatherPy**


This project dives into the world of weather data, exploring how weather patterns change across the globe. We'll analyse data from hundreds of cities at varying distances from the equator, focusing on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. By comparing these factors to a city's latitude, we'll uncover fascinating trends using scatter plots and linear regression.


Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude



**VacationPy**


In the second part, we'll transform this weather knowledge into unforgettable vacations. We'll leverage powerful tools like Jupyter Notebooks and utilise weather data to pinpoint our ideal destinations. Once the perfect location is identified, we'll even find hotels nearby using a handy location search!
